---

You will have two and a half weeks, until February 25th.

 * Construct a standalone webpage on GitHub that includes a vega-lite based
   data visualization.
 * This should utilize one or more CSV or JSON-formatted data sets, which you
   will need to clear with me first.  Identify something you are interested in
   and verify the license, suitability, and size.
 * Using at least three different types of marks, construct visualizations of
   this dataset that demonstrate univariate and bivariate modifications.
   (Three visualizations.)
 * Construct one faceted visualization that enables brushing and linking.
 * Write up (and hand in, but do not post on your website) your experience with
   this, including what you did and did not like about it.
