# COVID-19 Statement

In keeping with University and iSchool policy, all students are required to engage in appropriate behavior to protect the health and safety of our community.  If you are on campus, this includes wearing a facial covering properly, maintaining social distance (at least 6 feet from others at all times), disinfecting the immediate seating area, and using hand sanitizer.

If you feel ill or are unable to come to class or complete class assignments due to issues related to COVID-19, including but not limited to: testing positive yourself, feeling ill, caring for a family member with COVID-19, or having unexpected child-care obligations, should contact their instructor immediately and cc their advisor.

Additionally, please be aware that there are mental health resources available to students:
 * https://www.counselingcenter.illinois.edu/ 
 * https://mckinley.illinois.edu/medical-services/mental-health 
 * https://www.disability.illinois.edu/health/mental-health-resources 
 
Finally, due to the current messiness of the COVID learning environment, we are allowing up to three late homeworks.  If you need to “use” one of your late homeworks email the instructor and/or the TA.  You do not need to provide any explanation for why you’d like to use one of your late homeworks.  You will then have until the end of the week -- the Sunday after the homework was due, midnight -- to turn in this assignment.  

## Course Overview

This course will include a number of technical tasks, but will additionally be
focused on the aesthetic and high-level understanding of visualization.
We will discuss in depth new trends in visualization as well as evidence-based
studies of how to develop better visualizations.

Students are expected to have laptops with them, as well as access to Python
installations, and will be encouraged to participate in class.  Homework will
largely be in the form of projects and open-ended assignments.  Class
participation will not determine grades but is expected to guide discussions;
students are expected to participate and share thoughts, ideas, and
suggestions.

# Semester Calendar

It's been a while since this course has been taught, and the visualization landscape has changed in that time!
We are going to be approaching this from the perspective of:

 * Flexibility -- as we go along, not all topics will resonate with everyone, and we might make adjustments based on the technical and other interests of the class.
 * Playfulness -- we're going to be spending time experimenting, exploring, and learning things as we go.  You're going to be tasked with *having fun* with things, and using visualization technologies to express yourself.
 * Utility -- although we're going to try to have fun, we also will make sure that this course prepares you for future projects.  But, at the same time, we want to set you up for success, which means learning ways to distinguish yourself in the future.
 * Understanding -- We are going to apply technologies to visualization data by doing our best to understand what, why, and how data is manipulated and turned into visualizations.
 * Compassion -- the people who view your visualizations will come from different backgrounds, have different physiological and neurological characteristics, and we want to make sure that we are making our best effort to reach them and engage with them.

Because of this, the course outline below is subject to some flexibilty;
students will be encouraged to provide feedback on the topics covered,
particularly toward the end.  Topics that are of particular interest will be
emphasized.

Roughly speaking, we will cover theoretical topics and lectures during the first lecture of a week and during the second we will apply them to data.

 * Week 1 (Jan 26): Introduction, syllabus, and get-to-know-each-other, starting [p5js](https://p5js.org/)
 * Week 2 (Feb 2): Comparison-based visualizations (continuing p5, starting matplotlib)
 * Week 3 (Feb 9): Starting Interactivity (reactive programming, starting vega-lite)
 * Week 4 (Feb 16): Colors and colormapping (matplotlib, p5js with video)
 * Week 5 (Feb 23): The Web and the DOM (javascript, glitch, d3)
 * Week 6 (Mar 2): WebGL (GLSL, regl, threejs)
 * Week 7 (Mar 9): Scientific visualization (GLSL, python, 3D)
 * Week 8 (Mar 16): Deploying websites with visualizations (HTML, JS, github)
 * Week 9 (Mar 23): Streaming data
 * Week 10 (Mar 30): Advanced spatial data visualization (Vega, vega-lite, d3)
 * Week 11 (Apr 6): Server-based visualizations (Bokeh, plotly)
 * Week 12 (Apr 13): Visualizing really big data
 * Week 13 (Apr 20): Scientific visualization II (yt)
 * Week 14 (Apr 27): Putting it all together
 * Week 15 (May 4): Final presentations

## Pre- and Co-requisites

No explicit prerequisites are required.  Students are expected to have taken
standard programming courses.  Students are expected to either be familiar
with, or be prepared to familiarize themselves with, Python, Javascript,
GitHub, and other computational tools.  Haven taken Data Viz (IS590DV) is
optional, but encouraged.

# Land Acknowledgment

As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has
a responsibility to acknowledge the historical context in which it exists. In
order to remind ourselves and our community, we will begin this event with the
following statement. We are currently on the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia,
Peankashaw, Wea, Miami, Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi,
Ojibwe, and Chickasaw Nations. It is necessary for us to acknowledge these
Native Nations and for us to work with them as we move forward as an
institution. Over the next 150 years, we will be a vibrant community inclusive
of all our differences, with Native peoples at the core of our efforts.

[More information can be found on the Chancellor's
Website.](https://chancellor.illinois.edu/land_acknowledgement.html)

# Course Overview

The central themes of the course are:

1. What are currently-understood best practices for constructing meaningful and
   beautiful visualizations?
2. What is the "cutting edge" of software stacks for visualization?
3. What theoretical approaches to visualization can we utilize to improve our
   ability to understand data?

# Course Materials

There is no textbook for this course.  All course materials will be posted to
the GitHub repository at https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2021-adv/

As the course progresses, a list of recommended readings will be generated for
each class.  These will be included in the course materials repository, and
students are encouraged to fork that repository and issue pull requests to add
suggested readings.

# Academic Integrity

Please review and reflect on the academic integrity policy of the University of Illinois, http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html, to which we subscribe. By turning in materials for review, you certify that all work presented is your own and has been done by you independently, or as a member of a designated group for group assignments. 

If, in the course of your writing, you use the words or ideas of another writer, proper acknowledgement must be given (using APA, Chicago, or MLA style). Not to do so is to commit plagiarism, a form of academic dishonesty. If you are not absolutely clear on what constitutes plagiarism and how to cite sources appropriately, now is the time to learn. Please ask me!

Please be aware that the consequences for plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty will be severe. Students who violate university standards of academic integrity are subject to disciplinary action, including a reduced grade, failure in the course, and suspension or dismissal from the University.

Criteria for grading homework assignments include (but are not limited to) creativity and the amount of original work demonstrated in the assignment. However, students are permitted to use and adapt the work of others, provided that the following guidelines are followed:
 * Use of other people’s material must not infringe the copyright of the original author, nor violate the terms of any licensing agreement. Know and respect the principles of fair use with respect to copyrighted material.
 * Students must scrupulously attribute the original source and author of whatever material has been adapted for the assignment. Summarize the changes or adaptations that have been made. Make plain how much of the assignment represents original work.

# Statement of Inclusion

[Review the statement](http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/mission.html).

As the state’s premier public university, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s core mission is to serve the interests of the diverse people of the state of Illinois and beyond. The institution thus values inclusion and a pluralistic learning and research environment, one which we respect the varied perspectives and lived experiences of a diverse community and global workforce. We support diversity of worldviews, histories, and cultural knowledge across a range of social groups including race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, abilities, economic class, religion, and their intersections.


# Accessibility Statement

To obtain accessibility-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and the  [Disability Resources and Educational Services](http://disability.illinois.edu/) (DRES) as soon as possible. To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603 (V/TTY), or e-mail a message to disability@uiuc.edu.  

This syllabus may be obtained in alternative formats upon request. Please contact the instructor.


# Assignments and Evaluation

Students will be graded based on a combination of assignments (50%), a final
project (40%) and class participation (10%).  The final project will be a
capstone to the course, and will have greater flexibility in software packages
and data sources.

**In summary, your grades consist of:**

| 50% | Standard assignments in prose or code form
| 40% | Final project
| 10% | Class participation


Assignments in this course will be a mixture of coding/visualization work and
written work.  These two may not be distinct assignments; students will be
asked to describe their code and justify choices for making decisions with
respect to visualizations.

Students are expected, unless otherwise instructed, to be the principal authors
of their code.  This does not mean they may not investigate resources such as
StackOverflow, package documentation, etc; however, they *must* cite when
resources (especially StackOverflow and other "recipe" sites) are utilized.

Assignments will take two forms, and will be given at the end of each class.
Students will have until the following class to turn these in; assignments will
be collected electronically.

 * The first type of assignment will be a written document, constituting 
   either a brief literature review or an analysis of a visualization or
   set of visualizations.  The parameters for these assignments will be given
   during class, but will typically involve a critique of a visualization,
   including citing relevant works in the visualization literature.
 * The second type of assignment will be a hands-on, code-based assignment.
   Students will be provided either a dataset *or* a class of datasets from
   which they can choose, and construct one or multiple mechanisms of drawing
   information out of this visually.  These will be submitted in the form of
   Jupyter notebooks.  Each visualization must be accompanied by narrative
   description from the student describing why design decisions were made.

The submission process for homeworks will be described by example during class
before any homeworks are to be submitted.

Each assignment will be based on "correctness" and the narrative description of
the process.  "Correctness" in this case indicates that the code runs without
issue, results are produced, and each component of the assignment is completed.
The narrative description of the process will be graded on grammar minimally and
more so on completeness and thoughtfulness.

### Grading Policy

All assignments are required for all students, aside from one homework (lowest HW grade will be dropped). 
Completing all assignments is
not a guarantee of a passing grade.  You must do homework, visualization reports, and final to 
receive a passing grade. Late or incomplete assignments will not be given full credit
unless the student has contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the
assignment (or in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable).


**Grading Scale:**

| 94-100       | A
| 90-93        | A-
| 87-89        | B+
| 83-86        | B
| 80-82        | B-
| 77-79        | C+
| 73-76        | C
| 70-72        | C-
| 67-69        | D+
| 63-66        | D
| 60-62        | D-
| 59 and below | F

### Incompletes

Students must request an incomplete grade from the instructor. The instructor
and student will agree on a due date for completion of coursework and the
student must file an Incomplete Form signed by the student, the instructor, and
the student’s academic advisor with the School’s records representative. More
information on incompletes is available here:
<http://webdocs.ischool.illinois.edu/registration/incomplete_grade_form.pdf>

### Attendance Policy

Students are required to attend each class, and if they are unable to do so
must notify the instructor and TA in advance and request an excused absence.
Participation in class -- in the form of comments, questions, and discussion --
is expected.


## Emergency Response: Run, Hide, Fight

Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time. It is important that
we take a minute to prepare for a situation in which our safety or
even our lives could depend on our ability to react quickly. When
we’re faced with any kind of emergency – like fire, severe weather or
if someone is trying to hurt you – we have three options: Run, hide or
fight.


### Run

Leaving the area quickly is the best option if it is safe to do so.

- Take time now to learn the different ways to leave your building.
- Leave personal items behind.
- Assist those who need help, but consider whether doing so puts
  yourself at risk.
- Alert authorities of the emergency when it is safe to do so.

### Hide

When you can’t or don’t want to run, take shelter indoors.

- Take time now to learn different ways to seek shelter in your building.
- If severe weather is imminent, go to the nearest indoor storm refuge area.
- If someone is trying to hurt you and you can’t evacuate, get to a place
  where you can’t be seen, lock or barricade your area, silence your
  phone, don’t make any noise and don’t come out until you receive an
  Illini-Alert indicating it is safe to do so.

### Fight

As a last resort, you may need to fight to increase your chances of
survival.

- Think about what kind of common items are in your area which you
  can use to defend yourself.
- Team up with others to fight if the situation allows.
- Mentally prepare yourself – you may be in a fight for your life.

Please be aware of persons with disabilities who may need additional
assistance in emergency situations.
