  We'll start with following up on your projects and discussing what came up during office hours, then talk about how you can "get help" from online sources.

## Getting Help

 * [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) -- and searching for "SVG" is a good place to find attributes of individual objects we manipulate in d3
 * [d3 github pages](https://github.com/d3) -- the README files for individual sub-packages of D3 have detailed API references, along with links to ObservableHQ notebooks.  For instance, [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale).
