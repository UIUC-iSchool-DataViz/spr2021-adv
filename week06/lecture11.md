## Review of Us

 * We learned about vega-lite
 * We did a bit of D3
 * I've talked a little about publishing, etc
 * We should all mostly "get" Iodide now
 * We haven't yet really "put it together."

---

## Where We're Going

 * Let's finish up our intro-to-d3
 * We'll talk today about putting the "advanced" back in "advanced data visualization"
 * We're going to hit the ground running

---

## Topics

From here on out, we're going to eschew zero-dependency web environments a little bit.  We're going to talk about where to go, but here is what was originally planned:

 * Deep dive into color
 * GLSL and scientific visualization
 * Scientific visualization
 * Web *apps*
 * Advanced spatial visualization

## Your Environment

You will be expected to have a local development environment set up on your computer.  This needs to include:

 * Python 3.8 or 3.9, installed using Conda
    * Jupyterlab
    * Pandas, matplotlib, h5py
 * VS Code with these extensions:
    * `MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack`
    * `ms-toolsai.jupyter`
    * `ms-python.python`
    * `slevesque.shader`
    * `RandomFractalsInc.vscode-vega-viewer`
    * `WASTeamAccount.WebTemplateStudio-dev-nightly`

We will start with this *today*.
