## Matplotlib, bit-by-bit

We're going to dig into [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), starting with
the high-level `pyplot` interface and quickly moving on to the object-oriented
approach that lets us manage every aspect.

We will discuss:

 * Figures and canvases
 * Axes objects
 * Patches
 * Collections
 * Mapping and Mappables
 * Transforms
