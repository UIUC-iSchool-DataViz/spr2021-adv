description: Prototype a board game visualization

Hisss the game uses the six colors yellow, orange, blue, green, red and purple.
It contains six body cards of each of these pairs of colors: Yellow-Orange,
Blue-Green, Green-Yellow, Orange-Red, Blue-Purple, and Red-Purple.

There are seven head cards (one rainbow, and one for each color) and seven tail
cards (same). Develop and evaluate two different methods of visualizing the
state of a game of Hisss. Keep in mind what information you want someone
playing the game to see, how they process that information, and how actionable
it is.

This should take the form of a PDF submission including both the two different
depictions and a writeup for each.
