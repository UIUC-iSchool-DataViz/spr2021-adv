Explore the limits of comparison using spatial representation. Evaluate this in
the case that the numbers are nearly identical, in the case that they are
different by a factor of a few dozen and in the case that they are different by
a factor of a hundred or a thousand.

Experiment in these ways:

 * Use non-rectangular regions -- circles, perhaps triangles.
 * How does placing them in different locations change perception?
 * What about colors, uniformity, style?

We will use this as a basis for our first "evidence-based" examination. Prepare
both a writeup and a set of the visualizations where you have removed all
numbers.

Use real, meaningful data.  Submit this as either a PDF or a URL to a script.
